Main is the scene for whatever has been semi-finalized for the game. It is where we merge our prefabs.

Please duplicate the Main scene (ctrl-D) and rename it to your name, and that is where you can work on whatever you're making for the project.

That way, we can avoid conflicts in source control. Other than that, assets (scripts, sounds, textures, etc) can go in the appropriate folders, or in your own folder; whatever is convenient. The only thing we have to be careful about with git and Unity is working on the same scene simultaneously.
